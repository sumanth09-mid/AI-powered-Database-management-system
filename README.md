# AI-powered-Database-management-system

Intelligent Natural Language Querying • Real-Time Metadata Pipeline • Role-Based Governanc

An AI-assisted database management platform that enables users to interact with relational databases using natural language instead of SQL, while continuously monitoring query behavior through a structured data engineering pipeline.

The system transforms traditional databases into intelligent, observable, and governed platforms by combining:

1) AI-powered query translation

2)Role-based access control

3) Real-time metadata ingestion

4)Structured data lake architecture

5) Analytical dashboards

 Problem We Solved

Traditional databases:

Require strong SQL expertise

Lack built-in query observability

Depend heavily on manual performance monitoring

Offer limited governance at the application layer

This project introduces an intelligent management layer that simplifies querying, improves monitoring, and enhances security.


 What Makes It an AI Database?

This system adds intelligence on top of PostgreSQL by:

Converting English queries → Secure SQL

Validating queries based on user roles

Observing query execution patterns

Processing metadata through a data pipeline

Generating analytical insights from usage data

The database becomes self-aware and analytics-driven, not just a storage system.
